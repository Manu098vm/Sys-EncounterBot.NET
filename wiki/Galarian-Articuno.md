Once the result is found, you should go straight ahead to the plateau ahead of the clib. Articuno will be there. **Don't fly in another location, or the encounter will be rerolled.** If you fail to encounter it or you fail to catch it, you can restart your game, the encounter will remain the same.

You should find Articuno in this location:
