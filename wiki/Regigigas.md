## Save in the right location.
Be sure to have all the 5 regis in your team.

## Bot set up
First, download the Sys-EncounterBot: https://github.com/Manu098vm/Sys-EncounterBot.NET/releases.

Go in the Hub tab and select `Regigigas` under `SWSH_Encounter`.

Scroll to `ConsoleLanguage` under `FeatureToggle` and set it to your language.

Scroll to `StopConditions` and set them according to what you're looking for.

If you want to autorecord a clip once the target is found, I suggest to set the `ExtraTimeWaitCaptureVideo` to 30000.

Go back to the Bots tab, select `SWSH_EncounterBot`, click `Add` then `Start All`.
