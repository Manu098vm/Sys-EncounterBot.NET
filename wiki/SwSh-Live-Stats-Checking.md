# Quick Guide for General Pokémon Hunting
With the LiveStatsChecking mode, you can manually hunt Pokémons in a more classic way.

Every time a Raid, a Wild Encounter or a Legendary encounter starts, the bot will log the IVs, Shinyness, Nature, Moves, Marks for that Pokémon.

This way you don't need to catch the Pokémon every time to check its info.

## Bot Setup
First, download the Sys-EncounterBot: https://github.com/Manu098vm/Sys-EncounterBot.NET/releases.

Go in the Hub tab and select `LiveStatsChecking` under `SWSH_Encounter`.

Scroll to `ConsoleLanguage` under `FeatureToggle` and set it to your language.

Go back to the Bots tab, select `SWSH_EncounterBot`, click `Add` then `Start All`.
