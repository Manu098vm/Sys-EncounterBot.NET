# Quick Guide for Max Lair Boss Hunting
`This bot uses the Always Instant-KO cheat in order to have a better chance of beating all the opponents during the adventure. The cheat is dynamically activated and deactivated by the bot. `
`No cheats are used to generate the Pokémons nor to force specific stats or seeds, the encounters and the Pokémon rewarded are generated naturally within the game.`
`It's up to the user decides whether this is enough in their eyes or not.`
The Always Instant-KO cheat is taken from this [GBATemp thread](https://gbatemp.net/threads/pokemon-sword-shield-v1-3-1-cfw-emu-cheat-codes.579372/). Thanks to all the researchers involved.
