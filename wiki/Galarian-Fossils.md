# Quick Guide for Fossils Hunting
Thanks to the main SysBot.NET devs and contributors for the revival routine.

## Game Setup

Go to the game settings, set `Send to Boxes` to `Auto` and set the `Text Speed` to fast.

Check to have at least 1x of the fossils needed to revive the Pokémon you want to obtain.

Go ahead in front of the scientist who will revive your fossils.

Save the game.

The bot will revive the wanted Pokémon until you have enough fossil items. Once the fossils are over, the game will be rebooted to restart the routine.

## Bot Setup
First, download the Sys-EncounterBot: https://github.com/Manu098vm/Sys-EncounterBot.NET/releases.

Go in the Hub tab and select the Fossil you want to revive under `SWSH_Fossil`.

Scroll to `ConsoleLanguage` under `FeatureToggle` and set it to your language.

Scroll to `StopConditions` and set them according to what you're looking for.

Go back to the Bots tab, select `SWSH_FossilBot`, click `Add` then `Start All`.
