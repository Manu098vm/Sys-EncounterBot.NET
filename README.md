## Disclaimer:
I am doing this project for personal use and, above all, as a learning tool. Some bots are a proof of concept and they may work for me but not for you. If you run into any problems or have any suggestions, feel free to contact me, but please note that I may not be able to offer the support you are looking for. This is by no means a polished product.
## Support:
