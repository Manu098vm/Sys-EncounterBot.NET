# Quick Guide for General Pokémon Hunting
With the LiveStatsChecking mode, you can manually hunt Pokémons in a more classic way.

Every time a Wild Encounter, Legendary encounter, a Trade or a Gift will be detected, the bot will log the IVs, Shinyness, Nature, Moves for that Pokémon.

This way you don't need to catch the Pokémon every time to check its info.

## Bot Setup
First, download the Sys-EncounterBot: https://github.com/Manu098vm/Sys-EncounterBot.NET/releases.

Go in the Hub tab and select `LiveStatsChecking` under `LGPE_Encounter`.

Scroll to `StopConditions` and set them according to what you're looking for.

Go back to the Bots tab, select `LGPE_EncounterBot`, click `Add` then `Start All`.
