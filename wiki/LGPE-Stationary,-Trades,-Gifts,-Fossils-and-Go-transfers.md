Be sure to be in the overworld without any dialogue or menu opened before starting the bot.

If you're hunting for stationaries, be sure to have a strong pokemon in the first slot of your team, with a strong move in its first moves slot.

## Bot Setup
First, download the Sys-EncounterBot: https://github.com/Manu098vm/Sys-EncounterBot.NET/releases.

Go in the Hub tab and select either `Stationary`, `Gifts`, `Trades`, `Fossils` or `GoPark` under `LGPE_Encounter` depending on what you want to hunt.
You can make the game to spawn only Pokémon with specified Natures, by forcing the fortune teller activation in the `SetFortuneTeller` option.

Scroll to `StopConditions` and set them according to what you're looking for. Marks settings are ignored for LGPE Encounters.

Go back to the Bots tab, select `LGPE_EncounterBot`, click `Add` then `Start All`.
